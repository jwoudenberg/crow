# Crow

A database for Roc. Currently only a design.

## Goals

- Effortless storage and retrieval of any serializable Roc value, like a key-value store.
- Strict schema, indexes, foreign keys, like you have in a relational database.
- Roc is the query language.
- Built on top of SQLite, at least initially.
